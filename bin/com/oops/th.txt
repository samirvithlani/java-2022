Inheritance:
child class can use property of parent class it's called inheritance...
parent class can not use prop of child class


use:
resualblity:

5 types of inheritance:
1)single
		a ->b
2)multilelve
	a -->b -->c 
3)multipule
				a
			b        c	

4)hyricical
		             a
		      b              c       
         p        q     x            y
      m    n    al  bt    
5)hybride
					a --> 10 --> 5 ->
					
					
syntax:					
to implement inheritance in java use extends keyword
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

constructor:
def:constructor is a special function which has same name as class name
const does not have return type ..
const can have params

2 types of constructor:
1)default constructor
2)param constructor

use: to initilize instance variable of class, and initilize object of class...
constructor will load class in memory with help of class loader...

if there is no explicit constructor in java file , compiler(JVM) will create default construtor implicitly



poly
compile time
	method overloading
		def:function with same name but different arguement in same class called method overloading...
		search(int price)
		search(String name)
		search(int price,String name)
		search(String name,boolean avi)
		
runtime poly
	method overriding
	
	same function created in child class with same signature of parent class..
	access name param return type...
	



run time polymorephisam

parent class referene and child class object....it is called runtime polymorephisam
